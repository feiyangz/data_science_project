#1. I am very interested in performing an analysis of “data scientist” jobs listed on job boards and on the employment pages of major companies.
#2. I would do an inferential analysis, which aims to understand the most popular techniques required by employers.
#3. I am still thinking about how to collect data needed. Maybe I will try to check several websites such as indeed.
