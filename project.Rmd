###1.I plan to perform an analysis of “data scientist” jobs listed on job boards and on the employment pages of major companies.
###2.I would do web scraping on several popular job positing websites including [indeed](https://www.indeed.com) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/error_pages/unsupported-browser.html).
###3. Data will be cleaned and displayed using tables. I would also extract extra information career fields (IT, Business, research...), and probably geographic locations.
###4. Skills will be ranked and visualized. 
###5. Hopefully, this could provide job seekers with some basic ideas about skills that they are expected to have in their dream career fields.
